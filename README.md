# Gaussian Splatting in 2D

![Optimization Process](final_grid.gif)

## Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of Gaussian splatting in 2D. It covers the basics of Gaussian distributions, how to render them on a 2D grid, and the optimization of their parameters to match a target image.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The project depends on several Python libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt`.
